## Blocks

### Why use blocks?

* Visual programming (drag-and-drop)
* Generates Java code from the blocks
* No computer software required
  * Runs in a web browser when connected to RC
  * Code is stored on RC
* Intended for folks who’ve never written code before
  * Limited usability beyond what’s available
* Limited support from other teams and volunteers as many people aren’t experienced with blocks

### How do I get started?

* Connect to your robot via Wi-Fi or USB

## OnBotJava

### Why use it?

* Much simpler to set up than Android Studio
* All code is stored on the RC
* No clutter of other classes
