# Switching to Kotlin

### What is it?

Kotlin is a more modern version of Java, which allows for class extensions, null safety, and good class organization.  All of these reasons are good reasons to switch, but there is a high level of Java knowledge needed to make the switch effectively.

#### Class Extensions

Class extensions are a way of adding your own code to an already existing class. You could use this to for instance, convert a double to a string, if that isn't already in the class.

#### Null Safety
