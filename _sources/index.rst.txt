Updating your devices
=====================

Go to this `website <https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/getting-started/installation-instructions>`_. It will take you to rev hardware client. Once you download the app you will be able to connect the DS phone or the Control Hub, and it will show you your possible updates, take them all, and you are good to go! If you need to update your control hub from code, update it by looking at the latest commit on FTCRobotController and see what they've changed.

Feedback 
---------

I would love to have feedback on this repository. You can contact me through the discussions! Thanks!

Glossary 
=========

A repository is a folder hosted on GitHub that contains code and items.

A TeleOp is an opmode that uses your game-pad inputs to control your robot, it is on the right side of the phone when selecting an opmode.

An Autonomous opmode is an opmode that continuously loops for 30 seconds at the beginning of the match, it is on the left side of the phone when selecting an opmode.

My apologies if this doesn't work, some code software allows this exact code, some doesn't.
