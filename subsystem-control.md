# Subsystem Control

### What is it?

Subsystem control is another way of coding your FTC robot that involves splitting up functions, variables, and devices into different subsystems. For instance, you could have a drive subsystem or a deposit subsystem.

### Why use it?

Subsystem control is a very good way of abstracting your code and making it more readable. It also allows you to have consistent variables and naming across all classes you use. This means that you will be able to control it easier in theory. It allows you to call variables and change variables across classes extremely easily.
