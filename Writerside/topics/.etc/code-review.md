# Code Review

Code reviews are a handy way of making sure all your code works by asking
alumni to "approve" and comment on it with little overhead.

If you want to do code reviews with me, please DM me over Discord or email.



Here are general instructions on getting your GitHub repo ready for a code review.

1. Add my GitHub account as a collaborator on your repository (GramGra07)
2. Add a branch ruleset

   3. Leave the ones that are already selected on the ruleset
3. Create a new branch

   2. Add my account as a reviewer with the settings bar and make sure it is merging from the new branch to master/main
   3. Push the pull request and review the comments I leave on it!
