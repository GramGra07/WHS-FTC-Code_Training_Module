# Pedro Pathing

Pedro Pathing is a very convenient way to use completely splines in your code, it is a little more advanced than Road Runner (RR) in that it uses more force correctors like centrifugal force, and it uses several more PID's. I would only recommend this to experienced coders as tuning this is much more difficult than RR.&#x20;
