# Starting your project

To get started with GitHub, Android Studio, and Java Programming, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub account if you haven't already
2. Fork the [FTC Robot Controller](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) repository
3. Download Android Studio
4. Clone your forked repository if you haven't already
5. Open the project in Android Studio

You can combine steps 4 and 5 by cloning the repository directly into Android Studio using File -> New -> Project from Version Control.
