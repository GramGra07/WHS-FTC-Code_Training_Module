# Configuration

A configuration on your robot is how your robot will know where all of your devices are hooked up to the control and expansion hub. 

1. Press on the three dots in the corner of the driver station or driver phone.
2. Select the configuration option.
3. If this is your first time, hit the **scan** button to find your control and expansion hub, as well as any connected cameras.
4. A warning will appear indicating that it will override anything not saved on the driver station. Proceed if there is nothing saved.
5. Access the control hub or expansion hub portal.
6. Set up all of your hardware devices. These are defined in your code as Strings.
7. Select the type of device for each hardware device.
8. Copy the exact name from the code into the configuration menu.
9. Complete these steps for each device.
10. Save the configuration and give it a name (e.g., your team number).
11. Activate the configuration.
12. Select your opMode.
13. Press the init button.
14. Press the start button to start the robot.


Once you have done this a few times, I would recommend switching to my ConfigCreator, located [here](https://gramgra07.github.io/GentrifiedAppsUtil/config-creator.html)
