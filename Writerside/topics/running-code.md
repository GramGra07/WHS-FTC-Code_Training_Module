# Running Code

Once you have implemented all of your code, and you think it should do what you want, proceed through these steps!

### Running your code 

To put the code onto your robot, you will plug in the RC phone or the control hub to your computer and press the ![runa](run.png) button. It will take a bit to load and once it finishes, you can disconnect.

### Sloth

Sloth is a super handy utility used to speed up the builds to your robot, it is a Gradle plugin that will allow you to build your code and push it to your robot in a fraction of the time. To use it, you will need to add it to your build.gradle file. You can find the instructions on how to do this [here](https://github.com/Dairy-Foundation/Sloth/)

Note that you must do a normal run before you can use Sloth.
