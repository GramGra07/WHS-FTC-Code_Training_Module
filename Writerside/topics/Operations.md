# Operations

Operations are the fundamentals when checking for conditions. They are the building blocks of all programming languages.

`==` is equals

`!=` is not equals

`<=` less than or equal to

`>=` greater than or equal to

`>` greater than

`<` less than

You can also use these operations in conjunction with `&&` (and) and `||` (or) to check for multiple conditions.

For example, if you wanted to check if a variable was greater than 5 and less than 10, you would use the following code:

```java
if (variable > 5 && variable < 10) {
    // Do something
}
```

In this way, you can create complex conditions and make your robot function much better.
